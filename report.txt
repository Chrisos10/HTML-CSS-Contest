Part 2: Report
Introduction and Project Overview
In this project, we created a web-based application for a university alumni student organization that connects them with mentors for career development and other helpful and necessary events. The website consists of a landing page, which has a black background colour. It consist of  the logo, the links taking us to the different parts of the website which are the events, about us and the contact us segments, and beneath it is the name of the project which is called “ALUMNI NEXUS”. The motor of the project is right after and then after it is the aims and objectives of the site. After the first section is the second section which is the events section, it has a white background. This section has two parts to it, the, the “professional developments events” and the “campus events”. In the “professional developments events’” part we have a demo of at least 3 events there, which are a “coding booth camp” event, a “leadership vs management” event and a “career fair” event. Each event there has its own different date and its different description, different venue locations and also a button to make a reservation if an alumni is to attend which is then meant to add the event onto their calendar. Each event box is in a lime colour. The second part which is the “campus event” part also has a demo of at least 3 events to it which are a “tranquillity and balance” event, a “freshie’s night” event and an “inter-department competition” event. They also have different dates and different descriptions, but due to the fact they are campus events they all have the same locations which is the school+ campus. They are all in a lime coloured box with a RSVP button for the alumni to make a reminder on their calendar for the events they are interested on attending. The next is the ”about us page” is a page about as it said is about us the team members and our roles we played, It has our headshots in a circular frame with our names in it. The next is a “contact us” page where you can reach out to us by filling a form that is below it. The form can be used to ask questions or make reservations for an event. The form has bar where you insert your name, email, select a subject of matter and lastly fill in a message.
 Discussion on HTML Styling
We have 167 lines of code in our html, starting with the “!DOCTYPE html” tag as usual and then preceding with the “html” tag  with the language English in the tag. We then move to the “head” tag within it we have our “meta” tag our “title” tag which is “Alumni Nexus” and our “link” tag which links our CSS file and a “script” tag which links our Javascript file. The next is the “body” tag in which we have the “header” tag right after we have the “img” tag with an id in it where we inserted out website logo in it. Next we have the navigation section in which we started with the “nav’ tag within the “nav” tag we have a “ul” tag with 3 “li” tags in it which is the list for the “events, about and contact us” sections respectively and in each “li” tag is a “a’ tag with the href to each section of its name. Next is the welcome page section where we have “div” tag with a “welcome-content” class, within it we have a “h1” tag which has the  “Alumni Nexus” heading in it, and after that is the ‘p’ tag with an id ‘para1’ which has the ‘I’ and the ‘b’ tag to italic it and bold it and it contains the moto. After the ’div’ tag section we have a second header with a ‘h2’ tag with an id in it and the tag is about the ‘Aims and objectives’ with ‘p’ tag explaining the aims and objectives.

Discussion on CSS Styling
We used CSS to style the website, including defining background colours, fonts, and layout.
We applied styles to headers, navigation menus, sections, and forms to enhance the visual appeal of the site. Media queries were used to make the website responsive, ensuring it adapts to different screen sizes.
Discussion on Markup
We used HTML to structure the content, creating sections for mentors, the About Us page, and the mentor application form.
We incorporated semantic HTML tags to enhance accessibility and search engine optimization.
Discussion on Responsiveness
To make the website responsive, we used media queries to adjust the layout and content based on different screen sizes.
We ensured that the website is mobile-friendly and easy to navigate on various devices.
Conclusion, Challenges, and Recommendations
The project successfully created a simple website to connect students with mentors.
Challenges included ensuring cross-browser compatibility and fine-tuning responsive design.
To improve the website, consider adding user authentication for mentor applications and enhancing the mentor profiles with additional details.
This report summarizes the key aspects of the project, demonstrating how HTML and CSS were used to create a functional and visually appealing website that caters to the needs of the university student organization.
